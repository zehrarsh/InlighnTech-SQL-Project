Detailed Analysis about prevailing trends that influence consumer behavior and shape in the sonic palette of Musics and to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors contributing to an artist's success.

Project Overview: Welcome to the Music Data Analysis SQL project! This project aims to analyze and extract insights from a music dataset using SQL queries. By leveraging SQL, we can efficiently retrieve, manipulate, and analyze various aspects of music data, including artist information, song details, album tracks, user interactions, and more. The dataset used in this project contains the following tables: Artists: Contains information about music artists, including artist ID, name, genre, and nationality. Albums: Stores details of music albums, including album ID, title, release year, and artist ID. Tracks: Represents individual tracks within albums, including track ID, title, duration, and album ID. Users: Provides information about users interacting with the music platform, including user ID, username, and registration date. Listening History: Logs user interactions with tracks, including play timestamps, track IDs, and user IDs.

Project Objectives: Artist Analysis Retrieve information about specific artists, including their genre, nationality, and discography. Analyze the popularity and distribution of artists across different genres or regions. Album Analysis Explore details of music albums, including their titles, release years, and tracklists. Identify top-selling albums or albums with the highest listener engagement. Track Analysis Analyze individual tracks, including their durations, popularity, and listener engagement. Identify trends in track popularity over time or across different user demographics. User Interaction Analysis Investigate user interactions with tracks, including play counts, timestamps, and user preferences. Analyze user engagement metrics, such as average play time per session or frequency of interactions.

Methodology-
1. Right Click on schema side and then click create schema and type name of it as “musics” and click apply.
2. After creation of schema, we will create table.
3. Right click under schema musics and click create table and name the first table as “album”.
4. There are 3 columns of it so we will create them and click not null to get the data of that type only. 3 columns are named as album_id, title and artist_id.
5. Now select album table as “SELECT * FROM album; “.
6. Now copy the table of album from excel and paste it in album table is SQL by right clicking on it under table and then click apply to apply the changes.
7. Similarly create table artist, customer, employee, genre, invoice, invoice_line, media, playlist, playlist_track and track.
8. Create columns under these tables according to information in seen in excel.
9. After creation of columns select these tables in SQL one by one.
10. Copy paste the tables accordingly from excel and complete the tables.
11. Easy Level Queries:-
i. First question is “Find the most senior employee based on job title.”.
ii. Second question is “Determine which countries have the most invoices.”.
iii. 3rd question is “Identify the top 3 invoice totals.”.
iv. 4th question is “Q4: Find the city with the highest total invoice amount to determine the best location for a promotional event.”.
v. 5th question is “Identify the customer who has spent the most money.”.
12. Moderate Level Queries:
i. 1st question of this part is “ Find the email, first name, and last name of customers who listen to Rock music.”.
ii. 2nd Question is “ Identify the top 10 rock artists based on track count.”.
iii. 3rd Question is “ Find all track names that are longer than the average track length.”.
13. Advanced Level Queries:
i. 1st question in this set is “Calculate how much each customer has spent on each artist.”.
ii. 2nd question is “ Determine the most popular music genre for each country based on purchases..
iii. 3rd question is “Identify the top-spending customer for each country.”.
